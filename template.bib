Our algorithm satisfies differential privacy by adding noise that is adapted to the input data and to the given query set. We first privately learn a partitioning of the domain into buckets that suit the input data well. Then we privately estimate counts for each bucket, doing so in a manner well-suited for the given query set. Since the performance of the algorithm depends on the input database, we evaluate it on a wide range of real datasets, showing that we can achieve the benefits of data-dependence on both "easy" and "hard" databases.},

    abstract = { Abstract Histograms are the workhorse of data mining and analysis. This paper considers the problem of publishing histograms under differential privacy, one of the strongest privacy models. Existing differentially private histogram publication schemes have shown that clustering (or grouping) is a promising idea to improve the accuracy of sanitized histograms. However, none of them fully exploits the benefit of clustering. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering framework. It features a sophisticated evaluation of the trade-off between the approximation error due to clustering and the Laplace error due to Laplace noise injected, which is normally overlooked in prior work. In particular, we propose three clustering strategies with different orders of run-time complexities. We prove the superiority of our approach by theoretical utility comparisons with the competitors. Our extensive experiments over various standard real-life and synthetic datasets confirm that our technique consistently outperforms existing competitors. }

abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the problem of constructing a differentially private synopsis for two-dimensional datasets such as geospatial datasets. The current state-of-the-art methods work by performing recursive binary partitioning of the data domains, and constructing a hierarchy of partitions. We show that the key challenge in partition-based synopsis methods lies in choosing the right partition granularity to balance the noise error and the non-uniformity error. We study the uniform-grid approach, which applies an equi-width grid of a certain size over the data domain and then issues independent count queries on the grid cells. This method has received no attention in the literature, probably due to the fact that no good method for choosing a grid size was known. Based on an analysis of the two kinds of errors, we propose a method for choosing the grid size. Experimental results validate our method, and show that this approach performs as well as, and often times better than, the state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a novel adaptive-grid method. The adaptive grid method lays a coarse-grained grid over the dataset, and then further partitions each cell according to its noisy count. Both levels of partitions are then used in answering queries over the dataset. This method exploits the need to have finer granularity partitioning over dense regions and, at the same time, coarse partitioning over sparse regions. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we show that this approach consistently and significantly outperforms the uniform-grid method and other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {A mechanism for releasing information about a statistical database with sensitive data must resolve a trade-off between utility and privacy. Publishing fully accurate information maximizes utility while minimizing privacy, while publishing random noise accomplishes the opposite. Privacy can be rigorously quantified using the framework of differential privacy, which requires that a mechanism's output distribution is nearly the same whether or not a given database row is included or excluded. The goal of this paper is strong and general utility guarantees, subject to differential privacy. We pursue mechanisms that guarantee near-optimal utility to every potential user, independent of its side information (modeled as a prior distribution over query results) and preferences (modeled via a loss function). Our main result is: for each fixed count query and differential privacy level, there is a geometric mechanism M* -- a discrete variant of the simple and well-studied Laplace mechanism -- that is simultaneously expected loss-minimizing for every possible user, subject to the differential privacy constraint. This is an extremely strong utility guarantee: every potential user u, no matter what its side information and preferences, derives as much utility from M* as from interacting with a differentially private mechanism Mu that is optimally tailored to u. More precisely, for every user u there is an optimal mechanism Mu for it that factors into a user-independent part (the geometric mechanism M*) followed by user-specific post-processing that can be delegated to the user itself. The first part of our proof of this result characterizes the optimal differentially private mechanism for a fixed but arbitrary user in terms of a certain basic feasible solution to a linear program with constraints that encode differential privacy. The second part shows that all of the relevant vertices of this polytope (ranging over all possible users) are derivable from the geometric mechanism via suitable remappings of its range.},

abstract="The aim of privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) algorithms is to extract relevant knowledge from large amounts of data while protecting at the same time sensitive information. An important aspect in the design of such algorithms is the identification of suitable evaluation criteria and the development of related benchmarks. Recent research in the area has devoted much effort to determine a trade-off between the right to privacy and the need of knowledge discovery. It is often the case that no privacy preserving algorithm exists that outperforms all the others on all possible criteria. Therefore, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive view on a set of metrics related to existing privacy preserving algorithms so that we can gain insights on how to design more effective measurement and PPDM algorithms. In this chapter, we review and summarize existing criteria and metrics in evaluating privacy preserving techniques.",

The 12 patterns presented here have also been added to a freely editable Wiki repository.
